Q1) Given any two-dimensional array A with n-rows and m-columns, where the values of n 
and m are specified by the user at run-time. The entries in A are integers between 1 and 
100. Arrange the entries in array A according to the following policy: the small values must appear in the first (n / 2) rows in ascending order (notice 
that this is an integer division),the remaining values must appear in the remaining rows in descending order. 

Q2) Define a Student structure that contains fields for the student name, ID number and 
course grade (0 ≤ grade ≤100). Then define CourseGrades array of Student structures 
that keeps track of the list of students, IDs and their final grades for a given course.
